This script provides a function to activate a vim buffer by passing it the position in the buffers list and maps it to <M-number> to easily switch between open buffers.

This is best used together with the buftabs plugin: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1664
And even better with my slightly modified version: http://blog.micampe.it/articles/2007/03/28/enhanced-buftabs-vim-plugin
